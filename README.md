# Python Freggers Bot

## Important note
Freggers was a simple flash game to chat and play by the Spin AG until December 2020. 
Freggers.com / Freggers.de have been both shut down, hence this bot cannot be used anymore.

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher. Get it here: <https://www.python.org/downloads/><br/>(Including PIP and Python environment variables which are optional features in the installer)

### Installation

Open the command prompt (press WIN + R on Windows, type CMD and press ENTER) and type in:
>`pip install freggersbot`

To update use the following command:
>`pip install --upgrade freggersbot`

### Usage

Open the file example/start.bat to test if the bot is installed properly and starts as it should.
The file error.log should have been generated by now if everything runs fine.
You may add your own accounts to the bot.py file by editing it or code your own bot within it.

### TODO

- [ ] Auto reconnect on I/O errors
- [ ] Close bot after being logged out externally
